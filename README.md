## 📌 Project Overview

ThrashBeta is a community-focused smart waste management and reporting platform designed to help residents easily report waste-related issues and support cleaner, healthier urban environments.

The project improves communication between communities and waste management authorities by providing simple, accessible digital tools. This repository currently contains the **frontend implementation**, developed as part of a Software Engineering Capstone, with **Lagos, Nigeria** as the primary context.

## 🚮 Problem Statement

Waste management remains a major challenge in many parts of Lagos due to delayed reporting, poor visibility of waste issues, and limited community engagement. Existing reporting channels are often fragmented or underutilized.

ThrashBeta addresses this gap by providing a centralized, user-friendly web platform that encourages timely reporting and improves transparency.
